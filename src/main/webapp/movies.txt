Meanwhile, nine-year-old friend Pete finds himself in the same sinking boat. Together, Mister and Pete search for sustenance while attempting to avoid the violence that plagues their neighborhood. All the while Mister grows to feel invincible, never realizing that it's his vulnerability - not his youthful bravado - that's truly his saving grace. Jennifer Hudson, Jeffrey Wright, Anthony Mackie, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/30/11173017_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/30/11173017_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/30/11173017_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/30/11173017_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Skylan Brooks","id":"771072458","characters":["Mister"]},{"name":"Ethan Dizon","id":"771434105","characters":["Pete"]},{"name":"Jennifer Hudson","id":"364641735","characters":["Gloria"]},{"name":"Jordin Sparks","id":"770780859","characters":["Alice"]},{"name":"Jeffrey Wright","id":"162653065","characters":["Henry"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2113075"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771325225.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_inevitable_defeat_of_mister_and_pete/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771325225/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771325225/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771325225/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771325225/similar.json"}},{"id":"771324609","title":"Blue Jasmine","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":98,"critics_consensus":"Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine finds the director in peak late-period form -- and benefiting from a superb cast led by Cate Blanchett.","release_dates":{"theater":"2013-07-26"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Certified Fresh","critics_score":91,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":83},"synopsis":"A New York housewife struggles through a life crisis.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/16/11171692_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/16/11171692_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/16/11171692_det.jpg","original":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/16/11171692_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Cate Blanchett","id":"162659162"},{"name":"Alec Baldwin","id":"162656441"},{"name":"Alden Ehrenreich","id":"770833120"},{"name":"Peter Sarsgaard","id":"162653220"},{"name":"Michael Stuhlbarg","id":"770703651"}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2334873"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771324609.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blue_jasmine/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771324609/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771324609/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771324609/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771324609/similar.json"}}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit=30&country=us&page=1","next":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit=30&country=us&page=2","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movie/in_theaters.php"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit={results_per_page}&page={page_number}&country={country-code}"}
