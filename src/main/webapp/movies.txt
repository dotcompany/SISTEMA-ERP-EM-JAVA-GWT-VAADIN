Director Jolie began shooting some of the most dramatic and challenging scenes on Wednesday, October 16, on location far out at sea in Moreton Bay, Australia, with Zamperini (O'Connell) and his fellow airmen-Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mac (Finn Wittrock)-having impossibly survived being adrift in the open Pacific for several weeks. Working with cameras on a floating rig in choppy waters and braving the elements, with actors dieting for months to appear as depleted as their characters, Jolie completed a successful first day of a location shoot that promises to be rigorous and uniquely challenging. Adapted from Laura Hillenbrand's (\"Seabiscuit: An American Legend\") enormously popular book, Unbroken brings to the big screen Zamperini's unbelievable and inspiring true story about the resilient power of the human spirit. Starring alongside O'Connell, Gleeson and Wittrock are Garrett Hedlund and John Magaro as fellow POWs who find an unexpected camaraderie during their internment, Alex Russell as Zamperini's brother, Pete, and in his English-language feature debut, Japanese actor Miyavi as the brutal camp guard known only to the men as \"The Bird.\" The film is produced by Jolie, as well as Matthew Baer (City by the Sea), Erwin Stoff (The Day the Earth Stood Still) and Clayton Townsend (This Is 40). Leading the accomplished behind-the-scenes crew is 10-time Oscar (R)-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall). Academy Award (R) winners Joel and Ethan Coen (No Country for Old Men) rewrote the screenplay from earlier drafts by William Nicholson (Les Miserables) and Richard LaGravenese (HBO's Behind the Candelabra).","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/18/10/11181015_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/18/10/11181015_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/18/10/11181015_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/18/10/11181015_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jack O'Connell","id":"770771828","characters":["Lou Zamperini"]},{"name":"Domhnall Gleeson","id":"770702167"},{"name":"Finn Wittrock","id":"440715119"},{"name":"Garrett Hedlund","id":"162653184"},{"name":"Miyavi","id":"770873128"}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1809398"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/unbroken_2014/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552/similar.json"}},{"id":"771229367","title":"Annie","year":2014,"mpaa_rating":"PG","runtime":118,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2014-12-19"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":27,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":63},"synopsis":"A Broadway classic that has delighted audiences for generations comes to the big screen with a new, contemporary vision in Columbia Pictures' comedy, Annie.

Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around.

The artist earned staggering notoriety by revolutionizing the commercialization and accessibility of popular art with his enigmatic paintings of waifs with big eyes. The truth would eventually be discovered though: Keane's art was actually not created by him at all, but by his wife, Margaret (Amy Adams). The Keanes, it seemed, had been living a lie that had grown to gigantic proportions. BIG EYES centers on Margaret's awakening as an artist, the phenomenal success of her paintings, and her tumultuous relationship with her husband, who was catapulted to international fame while taking credit for her work.

FOXCATCHER tells the story of Olympic Gold Medal-winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Tatum), who sees a way out from the shadow of his more celebrated wrestling brother Dave (Ruffalo) and a life of poverty when he is summoned by eccentric multi-millionaire John du Pont (Carell) to move onto his estate and train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Desperate to gain the respect of his disapproving mother, du Pont begins \"coaching\" a world-class athletic team and, in the process, lures Mark into dangerous habits, breaks his confidence and drives him into a self-destructive spiral. Based on actual events, FOXCATCHER is a gripping and profoundly American story of fragile men who pinned their hopes for love and redemption on a desperate obsession for greatness that was to end in tragedy.
