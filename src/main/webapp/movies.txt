For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone). But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he.

Late one night, while watching cricket being played in India on TV, JB comes up with an idea so radical it just might work. Why not go to there and find the next baseball pitching sensation? Setting off for Mumbai with nothing but a gifted but cantankerous scout (Alan Arkin) in tow, JB stages a televised, nationwide competition called \"Million Dollar Arm\" where 40,000 hopefuls compete before two 18-year-old finalists, Rinku and Dinesh (Suraj Sharma, Madhur Mittal), emerge as winners. JB brings them back to the United States to train with legendary pitching coach Tom House (Bill Paxton). The goal: get the boys signed to a major league team. Not only is the game itself difficult to master, but life in the U.S. with a committed bachelor makes things even more complicated-for all of them. While Rinku and Dinesh learn the finer points of baseball and American culture, they in turn teach JB the true meaning of teamwork and commitment. Ultimately, what began as a purely commercial venture becomes something more and leads JB to find the one thing he was never looking for at all-a family.

Naive, innocent Anna soon finds herself in the presence of her aunt Wanda (Agata Kulesza), a worldly and cynical Communist Party insider, who shocks her with the declaration that her real name is Ida and her Jewish parents were murdered during the Nazi occupation. This revelation triggers a heart-wrenching journey into the countryside, to the family house and into the secrets of the repressed past, evoking the haunting legacy of the Holocaust and the realities of postwar Communism. In this beautifully directed film, Pawlikowski returns to his native Poland for the first time in his career to confront some of the more contentious issues in the history of his birthplace. Powerfully written and eloquently shot, IDA is a masterly evocation of a time, a dilemma, and a defining historical moment; IDA is also personal, intimate, and human. The weight of history is everywhere, but the scale falls within the scope of a young woman learning about the secrets of her own past. This intersection of the personal with momentous historic events makes for what is surely one of the most powerful and affecting films of the year.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/73/11177362_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/73/11177362_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/73/11177362_det.jpg","original":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/73/11177362_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Agata Kulesza","id":"770988935","characters":["Wanda Gruz"]},{"name":"Agata Trzebuchowska","id":"771463956","characters":["Ida/Anna"]},{"name":"Joanna Kulig","id":"770706904","characters":["Singer"]},{"name":"Dawid Ogrodnik","id":"771420673","characters":["Lis"]},{"name":"Jerzy Trela","id":"770697153","characters":["Szymon"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2718492"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771362047.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ida_2013/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771362047/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771362047/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771362047/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771362047/similar.json"}},{"id":"771318848","title":"Bears","year":2014,"mpaa_rating":"G","runtime":77,"critics_consensus":"Sweet, beautifully filmed, and admirably short on sugarcoating, Bears continues Disneynature's winning streak.","release_dates":{"theater":"2014-04-18"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Certified Fresh","critics_score":91,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":79},"synopsis":"In an epic story of breathtaking scale, Disneynature's new True Life Adventure \"Bears\" showcases a year in the life of a bear family as two impressionable young cubs are taught life's most important lessons.

Radisson begins class by informing students that they will need to disavow, in writing, the existence of God on that first day, or face a failing grade. As other students in the class begin scribbling the words \"God Is Dead\" on pieces of paper as instructed, Josh find himself at a crossroads, having to choose between his faith and his future. Josh offers a nervous refusal, provoking an irate reaction from his smug professor. Radisson assigns him a daunting task: if Josh will not admit that \"God Is Dead,\" he must prove God's existence by presenting well-researched, intellectual arguments and evidence over the course of the semester, and engage Radisson in a head-to-head debate in front of the class. If Josh fails to convince his classmates of God's existence, he will fail the course and hinder his lofty academic goals. With almost no one in his corner, Josh wonders if he can really fight for what he believes. Can he actually prove the existence of God? Wouldn't it just be easier just to write \"God Is Dead\" and put the whole incident behind him? GOD'S NOT DEAD weaves together multiple stories of faith, doubt and disbelief, culminating in a dramatic call to action. The film will educate, entertain, and inspire moviegoers to explore what they really believe about God, igniting important conversations and life-changing decisions. --(C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/59/11175915_mob.png","profile":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/59/11175915_pro.png","detailed":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/59/11175915_det.png","original":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/59/11175915_ori.png"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Shane Harper","id":"770846005","characters":["Josh"]},{"name":"Kevin Sorbo","id":"162676109","characters":["Professor Radisson"]},{"name":"David A.R.
