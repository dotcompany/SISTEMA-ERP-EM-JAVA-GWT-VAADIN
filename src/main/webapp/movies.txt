Starting as single-celled yellow organisms, Minions evolve through the ages, perpetually serving the most despicable of masters. Continuously unsuccessful at keeping these masters-from T. rex to Napoleon-the Minions find themselves without someone to serve and fall into a deep depression. But one Minion named Kevin has a plan, and he-alongside teenage rebel Stuart and lovable little Bob-ventures out into the world to find a new evil boss for his brethren to follow. The trio embarks upon a thrilling journey that ultimately leads them to their next potential master, Scarlet Overkill (Academy Award (R) winner Sandra Bullock), the world's first-ever female super-villain. They travel from frigid Antarctica to 1960s New York City, ending in mod London, where they must face their biggest challenge to date: saving all of Minionkind...from annihilation.

Movie star Vincent Chase (Grenier), together with his boys, Eric (Connolly), Turtle (Ferrara) and Johnny (Dillon), are back...and back in business with super agent-turned-studio head Ari Gold (Piven). Some of their ambitions have changed, but the bond between them remains strong as they navigate the capricious and often cutthroat world of Hollywood.

In the Mexican state of Michoacan, Dr. Jose Mireles, a small-town physician known as \"El Doctor,\" leads the Autodefensas, a citizen uprising against the violent Knights Templar drug cartel that has wreaked havoc on the region for years. Meanwhile, in Arizona's Altar Valley - a narrow, 52-mile-long desert corridor known as Cocaine Alley - Tim \"Nailer\" Foley, an American veteran, heads a small paramilitary group called Arizona Border Recon, whose goal is to stop Mexico's drug wars from seeping across our border. Filmmaker Matthew Heineman embeds himself in the heart of darkness as Nailer, El Doctor, and the cartel each vie to bring their own brand of justice to a society where institutions have failed. From executive producer Kathryn Bigelow (THE HURT LOCKER, ZERO DARK THIRTY), CARTEL LAND is a chilling, visceral meditation on the breakdown of order and the blurry line between good and evil. At the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, Heineman received both the Directing Award and Special Jury Award for Cinematography in the U.S. Documentary competition.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/0K6eKgsLwMrIDErvP1gWCCz5wsU=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/14/11191457_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/0K6eKgsLwMrIDErvP1gWCCz5wsU=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/14/11191457_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/0K6eKgsLwMrIDErvP1gWCCz5wsU=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/14/11191457_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/0K6eKgsLwMrIDErvP1gWCCz5wsU=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/14/11191457_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"4126304"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771412031.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cartel_land/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771412031/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771412031/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771412031/similar.json"}},{"id":"770799339","title":"Poltergeist","year":2015,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":93,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2015-05-22","dvd":"2015-10-26"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":33,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":25},"synopsis":"Legendary filmmaker Sam Raimi (\"Spiderman,\" \"Evil Dead\", \"The Grudge\") and director Gil Kenan (\"Monster House\") contemporize the classic tale about a family whose suburban home is haunted by evil forces.
