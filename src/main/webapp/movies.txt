Narrated by Idris Elba, the film flows likes a stream, with extraordinary time-lapse photography, sweeping aerial shots, and macro and micro lensed 3D propelling us from enchanted forests to the boiling edge of the underworld, from celestial ice-capped mountains and lava-spewing volcanoes, to crashing waterfalls and deep fantastical seas, as we experience some of the greatest gatherings of wildlife ever captured on film. With up-close-and-personal animal encounters and absolutely stunning scenery, this is an unspeakably beautiful film that presents nature in all her epic grandeur.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KGlGEcuzms9SflT2aIBOPxy4QTE=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/16/11191652_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KGlGEcuzms9SflT2aIBOPxy4QTE=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/16/11191652_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KGlGEcuzms9SflT2aIBOPxy4QTE=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/16/11191652_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KGlGEcuzms9SflT2aIBOPxy4QTE=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/16/11191652_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Idris Elba","id":"162654425"},{"name":"Hayley Joanne Bacon","id":"771616257"}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1762233"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771379541.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/enchanted_kingdom_3d/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771379541/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771379541/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771379541/similar.json"}},{"id":"771359910","title":"Terminator Genisys","year":2015,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":119,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2015-07-01","dvd":"2015-11-19"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":26,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":62},"synopsis":"James Cameron's sci-fi classic gets rebooted in this Paramount production designed as the first installment in a new trilogy. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dJI58rrq2j-YLSflD5sc-H7fAfg=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/11/11191190_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dJI58rrq2j-YLSflD5sc-H7fAfg=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/11/11191190_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dJI58rrq2j-YLSflD5sc-H7fAfg=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/11/11191190_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dJI58rrq2j-YLSflD5sc-H7fAfg=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/11/11191190_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Emilia Clarke","id":"771370354","characters":["Sarah Connor"]},{"name":"Jason Clarke","id":"359854726","characters":["John Connor"]},{"name":"Jai Courtney","id":"771383833","characters":["Kyle Reese"]},{"name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","id":"162662233","characters":["The Terminator"]},{"name":"J.K.
