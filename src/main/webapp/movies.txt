Director Jolie began shooting some of the most dramatic and challenging scenes on Wednesday, October 16, on location far out at sea in Moreton Bay, Australia, with Zamperini (O'Connell) and his fellow airmen-Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mac (Finn Wittrock)-having impossibly survived being adrift in the open Pacific for several weeks. Working with cameras on a floating rig in choppy waters and braving the elements, with actors dieting for months to appear as depleted as their characters, Jolie completed a successful first day of a location shoot that promises to be rigorous and uniquely challenging. Adapted from Laura Hillenbrand's (\"Seabiscuit: An American Legend\") enormously popular book, Unbroken brings to the big screen Zamperini's unbelievable and inspiring true story about the resilient power of the human spirit. Starring alongside O'Connell, Gleeson and Wittrock are Garrett Hedlund and John Magaro as fellow POWs who find an unexpected camaraderie during their internment, Alex Russell as Zamperini's brother, Pete, and in his English-language feature debut, Japanese actor Miyavi as the brutal camp guard known only to the men as \"The Bird.\" The film is produced by Jolie, as well as Matthew Baer (City by the Sea), Erwin Stoff (The Day the Earth Stood Still) and Clayton Townsend (This Is 40). Leading the accomplished behind-the-scenes crew is 10-time Oscar (R)-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall). Academy Award (R) winners Joel and Ethan Coen (No Country for Old Men) rewrote the screenplay from earlier drafts by William Nicholson (Les Miserables) and Richard LaGravenese (HBO's Behind the Candelabra).","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/u-nKl9xREJbL--JEtqIU6ODbeLY=/51x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/10/11181015_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/u-nKl9xREJbL--JEtqIU6ODbeLY=/51x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/10/11181015_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/u-nKl9xREJbL--JEtqIU6ODbeLY=/51x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/10/11181015_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/u-nKl9xREJbL--JEtqIU6ODbeLY=/51x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/10/11181015_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jack O'Connell","id":"770771828","characters":["Lou Zamperini"]},{"name":"Domhnall Gleeson","id":"770702167"},{"name":"Finn Wittrock","id":"440715119"},{"name":"Garrett Hedlund","id":"162653184"},{"name":"Miyavi","id":"770873128","characters":["Watanabe"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1809398"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/unbroken_2014/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552/similar.json"}},{"id":"771229367","title":"Annie","year":2014,"mpaa_rating":"PG","runtime":118,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2014-12-19","dvd":"2015-03-17"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":28,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":62},"synopsis":"A Broadway classic that has delighted audiences for generations comes to the big screen with a new, contemporary vision in Columbia Pictures' comedy, Annie.

But everything's about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) - advised by his brilliant VP, Grace (Rose Byrne) and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor, Guy (Bobby Cannavale) - makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in. Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around.

Profoundly affected by the death of his father, loved by a housekeeper he takes for granted and occasionally exploits sexually, he forms a close relationship with a seaside landlady with whom he eventually lives incognito in Chelsea, where he dies. Throughout this, he travels, paints, stays with the country aristocracy, visits brothels, is a popular if anarchic member of the Royal Academy of Arts, has himself strapped to the mast of a ship so that he can paint a snowstorm, and is both celebrated and reviled by the public and by royalty.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/J3M5weP9vdvT5GeBnjImO6-8DPM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/13/11181369_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/J3M5weP9vdvT5GeBnjImO6-8DPM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/13/11181369_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/J3M5weP9vdvT5GeBnjImO6-8DPM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/13/11181369_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/J3M5weP9vdvT5GeBnjImO6-8DPM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/13/11181369_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Timothy Spall","id":"162698684","characters":["J.M.W.

Meanwhile, Cristina Weiss (Olivia Williams) has her work cut out managing the career of their disaffected child-star son, Benjie (Evan Bird), a fresh graduate of rehab at age 13. Yet unbeknownst to them, another member of the Weiss family has arrived in town - mysteriously scarred and tormented Agatha (Mia Wasikowska), just released from a psych ward and ready to start again. She soon works her way into a friendship with a limo driver (Robert Pattinson) and becomes personal assistant to unraveling actress Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore), who is beset by the ghost of her legendary mother, Clarice (Sarah Gadon). But Agatha is on a quest for redemption - and even in this realm of the artificial, and the unearthly, she's determined to find it, no matter what it takes.
