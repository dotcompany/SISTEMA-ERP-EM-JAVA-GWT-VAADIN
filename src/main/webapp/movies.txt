As the days go on, a tenuous yet intense relationship seems to develop between journalist and subject. The two men bob and weave around each other, sharing laughs and also possibly revealing hidden frailties - but it's never clear how truthful they are being with each other. Ironically, the interview was never published, and five days of audio tapes were packed away in Lipsky's closet. The two men did not meet again. The film is based on Lipsky's critically acclaimed memoir about this unforgettable encounter, written following Wallace's 2008 suicide. Both Segel and Eisenberg reveal great depths of emotion in their performances and the film is directed with humor and tenderness by Sundance vet James Ponsoldt from Pulitzer- Prize winner Donald Margulies' insightful and heartbreaking screenplay.(C) A24","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Tac5z6fDqCfYyDcVEDWsxqLQ48s=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/13/11191376_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Tac5z6fDqCfYyDcVEDWsxqLQ48s=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/13/11191376_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Tac5z6fDqCfYyDcVEDWsxqLQ48s=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/13/11191376_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Tac5z6fDqCfYyDcVEDWsxqLQ48s=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/13/11191376_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jesse Eisenberg","id":"162654393","characters":["David Lipsky"]},{"name":"Jason Segel","id":"770670222","characters":["David Foster Wallace"]},{"name":"Anna Chlumsky","id":"162672651","characters":["Sarah"]},{"name":"Joan Cusack","id":"162655020","characters":["Patty"]},{"name":"Mickey Sumner","id":"771411230","characters":["Betsy"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"3416744"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771411936.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_end_of_the_tour_2015/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771411936/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771411936/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771411936/similar.json"}},{"id":"771359910","title":"Terminator Genisys","year":2015,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":119,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2015-07-01","dvd":"2015-11-19"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":26,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":61},"synopsis":"James Cameron's sci-fi classic gets rebooted in this Paramount production designed as the first installment in a new trilogy. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dJI58rrq2j-YLSflD5sc-H7fAfg=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/11/11191190_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dJI58rrq2j-YLSflD5sc-H7fAfg=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/11/11191190_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dJI58rrq2j-YLSflD5sc-H7fAfg=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/11/11191190_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dJI58rrq2j-YLSflD5sc-H7fAfg=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/11/11191190_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Emilia Clarke","id":"771370354","characters":["Sarah Connor"]},{"name":"Jason Clarke","id":"359854726","characters":["John Connor"]},{"name":"Jai Courtney","id":"771383833","characters":["Kyle Reese"]},{"name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","id":"162662233","characters":["The Terminator"]},{"name":"J.K.

Nelly (Nina Hoss), a German-Jewish nightclub singer, has survived a concentration camp, but with her face disfigured by a bullet wound. After undergoing reconstructive surgery, Nelly emerges with a new face, one similar but different enough that her former husband, Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld), doesn't recognize her. Rather than reveal herself, Nelly walks into a dangerous game of duplicity and disguise as she tries to figure out if the man she loves may have been the one who betrayed her to the Nazis. Evoking the shadows and haunted mood of post-war Berlin, Phoenix weaves a complex tale of a nation's tragedy and a woman's search for answers as it builds towards an unforgettable, heart-stopping climax.
