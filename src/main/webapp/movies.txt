Displaced from their native India, the Kadam family, led by Papa (Om Puri), settles in the quaint village of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val in the south of France. Filled with charm, it is both picturesque and elegant - the ideal place to settle down and open an Indian restaurant, the Maison Mumbai. That is, until the chilly chef proprietress of Le Saule Pleureur, a Michelin starred, classical French restaurant run by Madame Mallory (Academy Award (R)-winner Helen Mirren), gets wind of it. Her icy protests against the new Indian restaurant a hundred feet from her own, escalate to all out war between the two establishments - until Hassan's passion for French haute cuisine and for Mme. Mallory's enchanting sous chef, Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon), combine with his mysteriously delicious talent to weave magic between their two cultures and imbue Saint-Antonin with the flavors of life that even Mme. Mallory cannot ignore. At first Mme. Mallory's culinary rival, she eventually recognizes Hassan's gift as a chef and takes him under her wing.

When their government grants run out, the former three go into business as The Ghostbusters, later hiring Hudson on. Armed with electronic paraphernalia, the team is spectacularly successful, ridding The Big Apple of dozens of ghoulies, ghosties and long-legged beasties. Tight-lipped bureaucrat William Atherton regards the Ghostbusters as a bunch of charlatans, but is forced to eat his words when New York is besieged by an army of unfriendly spirits, conjured up by a long-dead Babylonian demon and \"channelled\" through beautiful cellist Sigourney Weaver and nerdish Rick Moranis. The climax is a glorious sendup of every Godzilla movie ever made-and we daresay it cost more than a year's worth of Japanese monster flicks combined. Who'd ever dream that the chubby, cheery Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man would turn out to be the most malevolent threat ever faced by New York City? When the script for Ghostbusters was forged by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, John Belushi was slated to play the Bill Murray role; Belushi's death in 1982 not only necessitated the hiring of Murray, but also an extensive rewrite. The most expensive comedy made up to 1984, Ghostbusters made money hand over fist, spawning not only a 1989 sequel but also two animated TV series (one of them partially based on an earlier live-action TV weekly, titled The Ghost Busters. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/74/11167403_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/74/11167403_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/74/11167403_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/74/11167403_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Bill Murray","id":"162653064","characters":["Peter Venkman"]},{"name":"Dan Aykroyd","id":"162664389","characters":["Raymond Stantz"]},{"name":"Sigourney Weaver","id":"162660903","characters":["Dana Barrett"]},{"name":"Harold Ramis","id":"162655463","characters":["Egon Spengler"]},{"name":"Ernie Hudson","id":"364643732","characters":["Winston Zeddmore"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0087332"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/12000.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ghostbusters/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/12000/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/12000/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/12000/similar.json"}},{"id":"771040382","title":"How to Train Your Dragon 2","year":2014,"mpaa_rating":"PG","runtime":105,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2014-06-13"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Certified Fresh","critics_score":92,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":92},"synopsis":"DreamWorks Animation returns to the world of dragons and Vikings in this sequel to their successful 2010 outing How to Train Your Dragon.

He presents himself as a businessman named Stanley Taplinger in order to debunk the alluring young clairvoyant Sophie Baker (Emma Stone) who is staying there with her mother (Marcia Gay Harden). Sophie arrived at the Catledge villa at the invitation of Grace, who is convinced that Sophie can help her contact her late husband, and once there, attracted the attention of Brice, who has fallen for her head over heels.

Gretta (Keira Knightley) and her long-time boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine) are college sweethearts and songwriting partners who decamp for New York when he lands a deal with a major label. But the trappings of his new-found fame soon tempt Dave to stray, and a reeling, lovelorn Gretta is left on her own. Her world takes a turn for the better when Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a disgraced record-label exec, stumbles upon her performing on an East Village stage and is immediately captivated by her raw talent. From this chance encounter emerges an enchanting portrait of a mutually transformative collaboration, set to the soundtrack of a summer in New York City.
