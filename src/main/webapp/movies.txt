Director Jolie began shooting some of the most dramatic and challenging scenes on Wednesday, October 16, on location far out at sea in Moreton Bay, Australia, with Zamperini (O'Connell) and his fellow airmen-Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mac (Finn Wittrock)-having impossibly survived being adrift in the open Pacific for several weeks. Working with cameras on a floating rig in choppy waters and braving the elements, with actors dieting for months to appear as depleted as their characters, Jolie completed a successful first day of a location shoot that promises to be rigorous and uniquely challenging. Adapted from Laura Hillenbrand's (\"Seabiscuit: An American Legend\") enormously popular book, Unbroken brings to the big screen Zamperini's unbelievable and inspiring true story about the resilient power of the human spirit. Starring alongside O'Connell, Gleeson and Wittrock are Garrett Hedlund and John Magaro as fellow POWs who find an unexpected camaraderie during their internment, Alex Russell as Zamperini's brother, Pete, and in his English-language feature debut, Japanese actor Miyavi as the brutal camp guard known only to the men as \"The Bird.\" The film is produced by Jolie, as well as Matthew Baer (City by the Sea), Erwin Stoff (The Day the Earth Stood Still) and Clayton Townsend (This Is 40). Leading the accomplished behind-the-scenes crew is 10-time Oscar (R)-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall). Academy Award (R) winners Joel and Ethan Coen (No Country for Old Men) rewrote the screenplay from earlier drafts by William Nicholson (Les Miserables) and Richard LaGravenese (HBO's Behind the Candelabra).","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/18/10/11181015_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/18/10/11181015_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/18/10/11181015_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/18/10/11181015_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jack O'Connell","id":"770771828","characters":["Lou Zamperini"]},{"name":"Domhnall Gleeson","id":"770702167"},{"name":"Finn Wittrock","id":"440715119"},{"name":"Garrett Hedlund","id":"162653184"},{"name":"Miyavi","id":"770873128","characters":["Watanabe"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1809398"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/unbroken_2014/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552/similar.json"}},{"id":"771349839","title":"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb","year":2014,"mpaa_rating":"PG","runtime":90,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2014-12-19"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":49,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":63},"synopsis":"Get ready for the wildest and most adventure-filled Night At the Museum ever as Larry (Ben Stiller) spans the globe, uniting favorite and new characters while embarking on an epic quest to save the magic before it is gone forever.

But everything's about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) - advised by his brilliant VP, Grace (Rose Byrne) and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor, Guy (Bobby Cannavale) - makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in.

They instead ended up arresting Turing himself on charges of 'gross indecency', an accusation that would lead to his devastating conviction for the criminal offense of homosexuality - little did officials know, they were actually incriminating the pioneer of modern-day computing. Famously leading a motley group of scholars, linguists, chess champions and intelligence officers, he was credited with cracking the so-called unbreakable codes of Germany's World War II Enigma machine. An intense and haunting portrayal of a brilliant, complicated man, THE IMITATION GAME follows a genius who under nail-biting pressure helped to shorten the war and, in turn, save thousands of lives.

The Keanes, it seemed, had been living a lie that had grown to gigantic proportions.

The film was written by E. Max Frye and Academy Award nominee Dan Futterman. FOXCATCHER tells the story of Olympic Gold Medal-winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Tatum), who sees a way out from the shadow of his more celebrated wrestling brother Dave (Ruffalo) and a life of poverty when he is summoned by eccentric multi-millionaire John du Pont (Carell) to move onto his estate and train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Desperate to gain the respect of his disapproving mother, du Pont begins \"coaching\" a world-class athletic team and, in the process, lures Mark into dangerous habits, breaks his confidence and drives him into a self-destructive spiral. Based on actual events, FOXCATCHER is a gripping and profoundly American story of fragile men who pinned their hopes for love and redemption on a desperate obsession for greatness that was to end in tragedy.
