But there was much more to this true American hero than his skill with a rifle. U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle is sent to Iraq with only one mission: to protect his brothers-in-arms. His pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and, as stories of his courageous exploits spread, he earns the nickname \"Legend.\" However, his reputation is also growing behind enemy lines, putting a price on his head and making him a prime target of insurgents. Despite the danger, as well as the toll on his family at home, Chris serves through four harrowing tours of duty in Iraq, becoming emblematic of the SEAL creed to \"leave no man behind.\" But upon returning home, Chris finds that it is the war he can't leave behind.

Director Jolie began shooting some of the most dramatic and challenging scenes on Wednesday, October 16, on location far out at sea in Moreton Bay, Australia, with Zamperini (O'Connell) and his fellow airmen-Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mac (Finn Wittrock)-having impossibly survived being adrift in the open Pacific for several weeks. Working with cameras on a floating rig in choppy waters and braving the elements, with actors dieting for months to appear as depleted as their characters, Jolie completed a successful first day of a location shoot that promises to be rigorous and uniquely challenging. Adapted from Laura Hillenbrand's (\"Seabiscuit: An American Legend\") enormously popular book, Unbroken brings to the big screen Zamperini's unbelievable and inspiring true story about the resilient power of the human spirit. Starring alongside O'Connell, Gleeson and Wittrock are Garrett Hedlund and John Magaro as fellow POWs who find an unexpected camaraderie during their internment, Alex Russell as Zamperini's brother, Pete, and in his English-language feature debut, Japanese actor Miyavi as the brutal camp guard known only to the men as \"The Bird.\" The film is produced by Jolie, as well as Matthew Baer (City by the Sea), Erwin Stoff (The Day the Earth Stood Still) and Clayton Townsend (This Is 40). Leading the accomplished behind-the-scenes crew is 10-time Oscar (R)-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall). Academy Award (R) winners Joel and Ethan Coen (No Country for Old Men) rewrote the screenplay from earlier drafts by William Nicholson (Les Miserables) and Richard LaGravenese (HBO's Behind the Candelabra).","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/18/10/11181015_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/18/10/11181015_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/18/10/11181015_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/18/10/11181015_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jack O'Connell","id":"770771828","characters":["Lou Zamperini"]},{"name":"Domhnall Gleeson","id":"770702167"},{"name":"Finn Wittrock","id":"440715119"},{"name":"Garrett Hedlund","id":"162653184"},{"name":"Miyavi","id":"770873128","characters":["Watanabe"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1809398"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/unbroken_2014/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771360552/similar.json"}},{"id":"771181360","title":"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies","year":2014,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":144,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2014-12-17"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Fresh","critics_score":60,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":76},"synopsis":"From Academy Award (R)-winning filmmaker Peter Jackson comes \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,\" the third in a trilogy of films adapting the enduringly popular masterpiece The Hobbit, by J.R.R.

Academy Award (R) nominee Quvenzhane Wallis (Beasts of the Southern Wild) stars as Annie, a young, happy foster kid who's also tough enough to make her way on the streets of New York in 2014. Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that they'd be back for her someday, it's been a hard knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). But everything's about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) - advised by his brilliant VP, Grace (Rose Byrne) and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor, Guy (Bobby Cannavale) - makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in. Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around.

The film was written by E. Max Frye and Academy Award nominee Dan Futterman. FOXCATCHER tells the story of Olympic Gold Medal-winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Tatum), who sees a way out from the shadow of his more celebrated wrestling brother Dave (Ruffalo) and a life of poverty when he is summoned by eccentric multi-millionaire John du Pont (Carell) to move onto his estate and train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Desperate to gain the respect of his disapproving mother, du Pont begins \"coaching\" a world-class athletic team and, in the process, lures Mark into dangerous habits, breaks his confidence and drives him into a self-destructive spiral. Based on actual events, FOXCATCHER is a gripping and profoundly American story of fragile men who pinned their hopes for love and redemption on a desperate obsession for greatness that was to end in tragedy.

It's the tail end of the psychedelic `60s and paranoia is running the day and Doc knows that \"love\" is another of those words going around at the moment, like \"trip\" or \"groovy,\" that's being way too overused - except this one usually leads to trouble. With a cast of characters that includes surfers, hustlers, dopers and rockers, a murderous loan shark, LAPD Detectives, a tenor sax player working undercover, and a mysterious entity known as the Golden Fang, which may only be a tax dodge set up by some dentists...

The Keanes, it seemed, had been living a lie that had grown to gigantic proportions.
