Gretta (Keira Knightley) and her long-time boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine) are college sweethearts and songwriting partners who decamp for New York when he lands a deal with a major label. But the trappings of his new-found fame soon tempt Dave to stray, and a reeling, lovelorn Gretta is left on her own. Her world takes a turn for the better when Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a disgraced record-label exec, stumbles upon her performing on an East Village stage and is immediately captivated by her raw talent. From this chance encounter emerges an enchanting portrait of a mutually transformative collaboration, set to the soundtrack of a summer in New York City. BEGIN AGAIN is produced and financed by Exclusive Media and produced by Anthony Bregman, Tobin Armbrust and Judd Apatow.

And, as Cage and Rita take the fight to the aliens, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy.(C) Warner Bros","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/87/11178706_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/87/11178706_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/87/11178706_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/87/11178706_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Tom Cruise","id":"162652763","characters":["Major William Cage"]},{"name":"Emily Blunt","id":"162685827","characters":["Rita Vrataski"]},{"name":"Bill Paxton","id":"162654226","characters":["Master Sergeant Farell"]},{"name":"Jonas Armstrong","id":"770796908","characters":["Skinner"]},{"name":"Tony Way","id":"770853907","characters":["Kimmel"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1631867"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771317257.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/edge_of_tomorrow/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771317257/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771317257/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771317257/similar.json"}},{"id":"771358910","title":"Think Like a Man Too","year":2014,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":106,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2014-06-20","dvd":"2014-09-16"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":25,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":67},"synopsis":"In the highly anticipated sequel, which was inspired by Steve Harvey's best-selling book Act Like a Lady, Think Like A Man, all the couples are back for a wedding in Las Vegas.

But in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker finds that a greater conflict lies ahead. It's great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone). But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: OsCorp.
