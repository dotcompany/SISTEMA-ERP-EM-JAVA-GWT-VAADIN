Now, in order to prove that he deserves his future bride, he must survive the most insane 24 hours of his life. For the past two years, high-school security guard Ben (Hart) has been trying to show decorated APD detective James (Cube) that he's more than just a video-game junkie who's unworthy of James' sister, Angela (Tika Sumpter). When Ben finally gets accepted into the academy, he thinks he's earned the seasoned policeman's respect and asks for his blessing to marry Angela. Knowing that a ride along will demonstrate if Ben has what it takes to take care of his sister, James invites him on a shift designed to scare the hell out of the trainee. But when the wild night leads them to the most notorious criminal in the city, James will find that his new partner's rapid-fire mouth is just as dangerous as the bullets speeding at it. John Leguizamo and Laurence Fishburne join the cast of the action-comedy directed by Tim Story.

When Walt Disney's daughters begged him to make a movie of their favorite book, P.L. Travers' \"Mary Poppins,\" he made them a promise-one that he didn't realize would take 20 years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney's plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn't budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history. Inspired by true events, \"Saving Mr. Banks\" is the extraordinary, untold story of how Disney's classic \"Mary Poppins\" made it to the screen-and the testy relationship that the legendary Walt Disney had with author P.L.

Together they seek vengeance upon the treacherous overlord who killed their master and banished their kind. To restore honor to their homeland, the warriors embark upon a quest that challenges them with a series of trials that would destroy ordinary warriors. 47 Ronin is helmed by visionary director Carl Erik Rinsch (The Gift). Inspired by styles as diverse as Miyazaki and Hokusai, Rinsch will bring to life the stunning landscapes and enormous battles that will display the timeless Ronin story to global audiences in a way that's never been seen before. -- (C) Universal","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/25/11172530_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/25/11172530_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/25/11172530_det.jpg","original":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/25/11172530_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Keanu Reeves","id":"162654049","characters":["Kai"]},{"name":"Hiroyuki Sanada","id":"162729305","characters":["Oishi"]},{"name":"Kou Shibasaki","id":"162700180","characters":["Mika"]},{"name":"Tadanobu Asano","id":"162697349","characters":["Lord Kira"]},{"name":"Rinko Kikuchi","id":"545585891","characters":["Witch"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1335975"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771218291.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/47_ronin/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771218291/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771218291/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771218291/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771218291/similar.json"}}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit=30&country=us&page=1","next":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit=30&country=us&page=2","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movie/in_theaters.php"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit={results_per_page}&page={page_number}&country={country-code}"}
